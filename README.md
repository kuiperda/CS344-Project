# CS344-Project

Solve puzzles from The Witness with a machine learning model.

For our project turn in:
## Important files are:
    Project.ipynb - all the supporting methods to generate data, etc
    classification_model.ipynb - our image classifier
    training_2_subset - the data we trained the classifier on
    
### Other files:
    data_cleaner.ipynb : originally cleaned our data for our older approach with a decision tree (before we changed our data)
    prediction_model.ipynb : our old decision tree model
    (various text files contain some of our puzzles that we generated)
